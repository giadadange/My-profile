				<h1>Hi! I am Giada</h1>

						Hello! I am Giada, I am half French and half Italian. I’ve lived in Rome my whole life and now study business in France. I like photography and exploring! I also really enjoy cooking, especially trying new cuisines. My favorite season is spring, even though I get allergies… but strangely enough my second favorite season is autumn. I have a dog called Ulisse, the cutest little doggy you’ll ever meet (he does bark a lot though). He is my best friend and I miss him a lot.</p>

				<h2><strong>Photography</strong></h2>
					<p>I very much enjoy photography. More so nature because I’ve grown up near parks and nature my whole life despite living in a city. Luckily I lived next to my favorite park when I lived in Rome, I would go there and take pictures of all the little creatures as well as the people enjoying the sunlight. My favorite time to go take pictures is during the chance of spring into summer as more flowers and plants bloom and creatures come out into the open.</p>

				<h2><strong>Cooking</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Cooking is also something I truly enjoy. Growing up in an international environment, both at home and at school, I’ve always eaten non-traditional foods. My best friends come from all around the world, including India, Palestine and Tanzania, thus teaching me about their eating habits. I truly enjoy this as I see it as a way to travel the world without moving around!

				<h2><strong>Crochet</strong></h2>
					<p>One of my best friends is a HUGE Harry Styles fan, and really wanted to purchase one of his famous crocheted jumpers. However she couldn’t as it was really expensive. That’s when I stepped in!! As a birthday present to her I decided to take on crocheting, which then lead to a hobby. I have made hats, scarfs and now are attempted to create tops for summer.</p>
